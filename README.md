<h1>Subqueries and Nested Queries</h1>

<h2>📌Objective</h2>
<mark>Use subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM</mark><br>
In this task, I've used an employee database with various different tables to dive deep into and gain practical knowledge related to subqueries as a part of Data Manipulation Language in SQL.

1. <mark>README.md</mark> --> Project Description <br>
2. <mark>task_4_database.sql</mark> --> SQL script with employee data - tables emp(employee table) and dept(department table)<br>
3. <mark>subqueries_scriptfile.sql</mark> --> SQL script with subqueries used in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses along with correlated subqueries

<h2>🛠️ Tools and SQL Techniques Used</h2>
1. MySQL Workbench <br>
2. Subqueries in SQL : Also known as an 'inner query' or 'nested query'. It is a query embedded under another query, where the results of the subquery are used by the outer query to further refine or filter the data being retrieved. <br>
3. Subqueries are of many types such as Scalar subqueries, Correlated subqueries, and nested subqueries. <br>
4. Subqueries can be used under various different statements and clauses such as SELECT (case when), WHERE, and FROM (Join clause)<br>
5. Correlated subqueries contain a reference to the table that appears in the outer query, it is a subquery that uses calues from the outer query.<br>
      
<h2> 📈 Insights Derived </h2>
- Embedded a subquery under SELECT clause using case statement <br>
- Used a subquery under FROM clause using JOIN statements<br>
- Used a subquery under SELECT and FROM in the same query<br>
- Embedded several subqueries under WHERE statements using IN, EXISTS, and other arthmetic operators<br>
- Used correlated subqueries<br>



<h2>📋Developer's Note</h2>
This task is meant to familarize you with the advanced SQL DML using subqueries, scalar and correlated, embedded under various SQL statements.
